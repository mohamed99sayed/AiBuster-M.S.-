# AiBuster 🤖🚫

> **Detect Deepfakes with Ensemble AI on Android**

AiBuster is a robust Android application capable of detecting AI-generated images (Deepfakes) directly on your device. Powered by an ensemble of **8 PyTorch Lite models**, it analyzes image artifacts to distinguish between real photos and synthetic media with high confidence.

## ✨ Features

*   **Ensemble Precision**: Aggregates predictions from 8 different neural networks for superior accuracy.
*   **Privacy First**: All processing is done **locally (offline)** using on-device inference. No images are ever uploaded to a server.
*   **Real-time Analysis**: Get instant "REAL" or "FAKE" classification with detailed confidence scores.
*   **Simple UI**: Clean, user-friendly interface for quick verification.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Android**: Kotlin, Navigation Component, ViewBinding.
*   **Machine Learning**: PyTorch Mobile (Android Lite).
*   **Models**: 8x optimized `.ptl` models (Ensemble method).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Android Studio (Ladybug or newer recommended).
*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.
*   Android Device or Emulator running Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AiBuster.git
    cd AiBuster
    ```

2.  **Open in Android Studio**
    *   Launch Android Studio -> `Open` -> Select the `AiBuster` folder.

3.  **Sync Dependencies**
    *   Let Gradle sync and download the necessary PyTorch libraries.

4.  **Add Models**
    *   Ensure the 8 model files (`model1.ptl` ... `model8.ptl`) are placed in `app/src/main/assets/`.
    *   *(Note: These models are required for the app to function)*.

5.  **Run the App**
    *   Press the ▶️ **Run** button to deploy to your connected device or emulator.

## 📱 How to Use

1.  Launch **AiBuster** on your Android device.
2.  Tap the **Upload / Select Image** area.
3.  Choose a photo from your gallery that you want to verify.
4.  Confirm the selection and tap **Classify**.
5.  View the result:
    *   **REAL**: The image is likely authentic.
    *   **FAKE (AI)**: The image contains artifacts suggesting it was generated by AI.
    *   **Confidence**: The percentage certainty of the model's prediction.
